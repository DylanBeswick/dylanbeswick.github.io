    	<p class="block">I shudder as I climb the ladder. <br>I don’t know if I’ll survive. <br>Will I be lucky to come out alive?<br>After weeks of climbing, I finally reach the top.<br>And I look down to the ground, just a nine thousand meter drop.<br>I let the attendant put a harness on me, all nice and tight. <br>I guess I’m just too scared to put up a real fight.<br>When I finally wake from my daze of terror, it is too late.<br>Is this really going to be my fate?<br>Somehow I’m trembling, hanging from the line.<br>It didn’t help when they said I’d be fine.<br>My muscles are like concrete, they’re so tense.<br>Why did I do this? I’m so dense.<br>My harness hugs me, while I think about my doom.<br>Suddenly the attendant pulled a string…<br>SHOOM<br>I open my eyes at 5 trillion meters from the ground.<br>When I fall, how many decades will it take me to be found?<br>I feel the air rushing past, and the sun’s heat.<br>Wait. I admit it. This is actually kind of sweet.<br>I zip along the rest of the way feeling as bold as ten grown men.<br>Thinking the whole time “I’m definitely doing this again" </p>
